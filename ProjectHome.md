Transdroid Torrent Search is a reusable Android application that merely provides torrent search results (links to .torrent files) from various web sources. These results are exposed via a ContentProvider that multiple Android apps can use to search for torrents while maintaining control over the search interface.

See the [usage instructions](Usage.md) on how to query ContentProvider.

Originally part of [Transdroid](http://code.google.com/p/transdroid/), it is also used in the [Synodroid](http://code.google.com/p/synodroid-ds/) and [tTorrent](http://ttorrentforandroid.blogspot.com/) apps.
